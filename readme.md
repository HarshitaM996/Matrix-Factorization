This code runs on google colab(https://colab.research.google.com/), it can be modified by editing the data = line in the last cell.
Input should be in the format of (ndarray, int) which is,
the data, and the number of features.

It was observed that gradiant descent method, that was implemented in the code, reaches to the solution eventually on increasing the number iterations and by increasing the number of features.

The code uses numpy library on python to do matrix operations and operate on matrices, for example sum of all elements.
